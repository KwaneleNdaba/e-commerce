when we change the types of the payload we have run 
yarn payload  generate:graphQLSchema and yarn generate:types 

how we added a custom hero

first create a folder and relevant pages inside the folder

//components/heros
add the custom hero under the array of heros
//payload/fields
add additional fields of custom hero
and also the condtions 
//payload-types
under thae page interface, add the customHero

//fetching categories 
first we modified the interface of categories under payload categories by adding a media field 
after that we added a queryMap under api/fetchDoc by specifying that we also want to fetch the categories  from the backend 
we also modified the _graphql/categories by limit the number of categories we fetch and also the field that we want
since we change the name of the categories we fetching under the fetchDoc we need to change it also under _graphql/blocks and also under _graphql/products
